# Data Analysis with SQL

 This GitHub repository contains all kinds of __SQL queries__ which can be written to retreive and manipulate data from a database.The detailed database information used to perform all queries is attached for the reference.

_MYSQL_1_ file represents queries to show how many tables the database has, and identify the fields contained in each table of the database. For this purpose, __SHOW, DESCRIBE, SELECT and LIMIT__ statemnets are used.

_MYSQL_2_ file show queries to address the issues related to the database and what we want to achieve from database in a sequential manner. 

* Many useful SQL statements have been used in this file such as __DISTINCT, WHERE, ON, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, IN__ and so on.

* The aggregate functions are used such as __MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM, AVG and STDDEV__. 

* Logical functions such as __AND, OR, NOT__ in addition to __IS NULL ad IS NOT NULL__ are tested.

* The __aliases__ are quite often used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

* Different __JOIN__ clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.  __RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN and FULL  OUTER JOIN__ are implemented to achieve the desired results.

_MYSQL_3_ file represent all queries mentioned in above files and following:

* The __CASE__ statements are used which goes through required conditions and returns a value according to the conditions met (like an __IF-THEN-ELSE__ statement).

* It is also shown how to incorporate __subqueries and derived tables__ into our queries.Subqueries are queries that are embedded within the context of another query.It can be used in __SELECT, WHERE, and FROM__ clauses. When they are used in FROM clauses they create what are called derived tables.
