# Data Analysis with SQL

 This GitHub repository contains all kinds of SQL queries which can be written to retreive and manipulate data from a database.The detailed database information used to perform all queries is attached for the reference.

MYSQL_1 file represents queries to show how many tables the database has, and identify the fields contained in each table of the database. For this purpose, SHOW, DESCRIBE, SELECT and LIMIT statemnets are used.

MYSQL_2 file show queries to address the issues related to the database and what we want to achieve from database in a sequential manner. 

* Many useful SQL statements have been used in this file such as DISTINCT, WHERE, ON, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, IN and so on.

* The aggregate functions are used such as MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM, AVG and STDDEV. 

* Logical functions such as AND, OR, NOT in addition to IS NULL ad IS NOT NULL are tested.

* The aliases are quite often used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

* Different JOIN clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.  RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN and FULL  OUTER JOIN are implemented to achieve the desired results.

MYSQL_3 file represent all queries mentioned in above files and following:

* The CASE statements are used which goes through required conditions and returns a value according to the conditions met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement).

* It is also shown how to incorporate subqueries and derived tables into our queries.Subqueries are queries that are embedded within the context of another query.It can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses. When they are used in FROM clauses they create what are called derived tables.
